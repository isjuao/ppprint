            For a successful upload, <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">ppprint</span> expects a compressed version
            of <a href="https://predictprotein.org/" class="card-link">PredictProtein</a> predictions. In the tar
            archive, there must be one directory per prediction job (== per proteome split). Each directory must contain
            the raw prediction files for each protein from the respective proteome split. Here, the prediction files for
            a single sequence must include but are not limited to files of the following extensions:
            <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">.fasta, .metadisorder, .tmseg, .prona, .reprof</span>. By the nature
            of PredictProtein, it is okay if certain job folders or output files are missing.
            For a short description of how this structure can be achieved, please read below.

            When running a local installation of PredictProtein, it is recommended to previously split the proteome
            for which prediction is to be performed into smaller <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">.fasta</span>
            files. Then, PredictProtein can be called for each <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">.fasta</span>
            file and store result files into a separate folder. That way, the user should end up with a number of job
            directories consisting of all prediction result files for each protein from the respective proteome split.
            For SARS-CoV-2, an exemplary data structure with predictions generated by PredictProtein prior to
            compression is provided
