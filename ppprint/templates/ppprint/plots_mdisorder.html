As a sup-ordinate definition applying to all types of disorder, disordered regions (DRs) in proteins can be defined as a those regions, which adopt two potentially widely different three-dimensional (3D) structures in isolation, when observed at two different points in time. Simply put, they lack a stable 3D structure. Research of the past one and a half decade has discovered that protein disorder is conserved in evolution. Since the flexibility of DRs could be utilized to regulate complex protein interactions, the level of disorder prevalent in an organism’s proteome could hint at its biological complexity." %}

                            {% trans "The definition of protein disorder covers multiple phenomena regarding lack of structure, including local flexible loops. Those disorder loops behave differently than shorter loops in non-regular secondary structure, with length being a key factor for machine learning methods distinguishing the two. Although there is no scientific reality for a particular threshold level, it is biophysically safe to discern regular flexible loop regions in well- structured proteins from loopy disordered at a length of 30 residues. Thus, any predicted disordered regions (DRs) with a length smaller than 30 are excluded. In PredictProtein, multiple original tools are combined in Meta-Disorder (MD) [1] in order to predict disordered regions in proteins." %}

The disorder spectrum plot captures the mean relative start and end positions of all disordered regions (DRs) centered at the respective x-value. Here, 95% confidence intervals are given as shaded intervals around each curve. The curve connects the mean positions of all x-values and gives the spectrum plot its name. Positions without any present DR centers  are excluded from the plot. The shape of the disorder spectrum plot is trivially limited. As center positions move to the ends of the normalized protein (y ∈ {0.0, 1.0}), the absolute maximum of start and end positions, being relative to the center, decreases. For instance, a DR centered at the relative index of 0.9 can have a maximum total width of 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2, being restricted by the end of the protein. Disordered regions centered around 0.5 however can span the whole protein and thus reach a width of 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0, from protein start to end. One way of measuring the visual correlation of two disorder spectra is calculating the cross-correlation (CC) for each pair of proteomes. During the development of ppprint, CC was found to distinctly separate the pairings based on the combination of their kingdoms. Corresponding zones are explained in the legend." %}
