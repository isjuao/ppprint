                            A protein can fold into its native shape even when it is isolated from the cell, implying
                            that
                            the amino acid sequence alone determines the structure of a protein. On a lower complexity
                            level than estimating the 3D shape of a protein, this discovery allows the prediction of
                            secondary structure elements, using only the sequence. The structural elements as specified
                            in
                            the 8-state DSSP assignment can be simplified into three groups: helix (H), strand (E) and
                            other
                            states (O).
                            <br> In ppprint, RePROF [1] is used to predict whether an amino acid residue belongs to a
                            H, E or O part of the protein. As a locally forming structural element, helices require a
                            minimum
                            of four consecutive compatible residues to be formed. Thus, four amino acid residues serves
                            as a
                            minimum length for helical regions predicted by RePROF.
